# SCALE Battery Concept

## Concept
Software architecture is based in one hand, on a master application managing most Devices, and on another hand, on several procedure executing the test (call instances);

<p align="center"> <img src="./images/Battery_Concept.png" style="width: 100%;" />

Objective is to keep all instances as identical as possible. Only some interfaces can change;
* BMS
* Specif devices.

A specific configuration (hardware connexion) can also be done for every instance.

## Configuration

### Hardware Configuration

Hardware configuration is not different when you have one instance that when you have several instances.

Just note that some MORPHEEÂ® features are multi-instances compliant and some others not;
