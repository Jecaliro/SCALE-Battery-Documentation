Generally this step is performed by our team and you just need  to enjoy SCALE Battery use.
 
In case of upgrade, all version are accessible in our [donwload area](https://download.fev-software.com/DownloadPortal/pages/DownloadPortal)

## Application Installation

In the same way, it is preferable to leave the installation of SCALE Battery to the FEV teams. 
Nevertheless a **ZBENCH** of the application is also available on our [donwload area](https://download.fev-software.com/DownloadPortal/pages/DownloadPortal).

Basic SCALE BAttery installation do not take care of your particular configuration. We recommend to backup your configuration before performing a new one
