# Writing a test

## Basics

### Selecting components used in a test

To be able to access all needed functionnality while writting a test, it is necessary to add the adapted components in the test itself:

### Using component Methods to write a test

To write a test, it is necessary to use component methods dedicated for that. 

In General:

- CONTROL_MANAGEMENT is dedicated to apply the requested setpoint to UUT whatever is the configuration and whatever is the physical energy system. Configuration is handled by the MULTIINSTANCE_MANAGEMENT component in the master configuration. CONTROL_MANAGEMENT is linked with the ENERGY_SYSTEM_SHARING
- CLIMATIC_CHAMBER_SHARING is dedicated to manage the temperature of the test. It will be synchronize with others instances in regards to the global configuration.
- COOLANT_COND_SHARING is dedicated to manage the temperature of the UUT cooling. You can start it, stop it and select the needed setpoint.

Methods to use are as follow;

### Using Parameters to write a test

Parameters are very important to standardize test configuration and test writing. Use them as much as possible;
- To securize a test
- To parametrize a test
- To fix some limits...

**SCALE** provides some parameters that you can 'fixed' directly in the configuration, or that you can 'overwritte' by **FlexLabÂ®** or others way (see [interfacing through file](09_interfacing_through_file.md) for example).
You can also add as many parameter as you want to customize your application!
