# Base configuration

```{important}
This documentation will not develop the hardware and feature configuration.
This has to be done previously.

Nevertheless, it will be possible to test all equipment one by one when it will be possible to start MORPHEEÂ® master instance. 
```

## Principle

Concept of the SCALE Battery configuration is to use most of the equipment in the master instance and to give the possibility for each instance to attach to one (or more) equipment through 'Sharing' components;

```
````

The Sharing equipments take care of all present equipment of the familly;

ENERGY_SYSTEM_SHARING 
*   ENERGY_SYSTEM_1
*   ENERGY_SYSTEM_2
*   ...
*   ENERGY_SYSTEM_x

### Configuration in UEditor

Here is an example of a standard Bench configuration;

```{image} ./images/UEditor_Bench_config.png
:align: center
:width: 250 px
```


````{hint}
To avoid re-design of the Dashboard, it makes sense to always use all equipment in the Bench configuration and make the link 'Optional' if they are not used;
```{image} ./images/UEditor_Link_Optionnal.png
:align: center
```
````

### MultiInstance configuration

Before starting, you need also to configure the MULTIINSTANCE_MANAGEMENT component:

![](./images/UEditor_MM_Configuration.png)

By default, you can configure as follow;
| Parameter           | Description                  | Value      |
|---------------------|------------------------------|------------:|
| P_MIM.NB_INSTANCES  | Quantity of MORPHEE Instance | 8          |
| P_MIM.DATA_HANDLING |   Management of parameters   | By MORPHEE |
|  |      |  |


### Configuration without any hardware

```{note}
All component existing in your configuration but not present in this table can be put as 'Optional' 
```

### Configuration with hardware

The configuration with hardware is not so different. You just have to replace 'Simulated' equipments with real one, and add your own component if needed (Acquisition, Hardware, etc...).

The table below is not exhaustive but show the configuration concept by using hardware:

| Master configuration (In Bench cfg)    | 
|----------------------------------------|
| MANAGEMENT                             |
| MULTIINSTANCE_MANAGEMENT               |
| ENERGY_SYSTEM_SHARING.***MASTER***     |
| ENERGY_SYSTEM_1.*Real device*        |
| ENERGY_SYSTEM_2.*Real device*        |
| ENERGY_SYSTEM_3.*Real device*        |
| ENERGY_SYSTEM_4.*Real device*        |
| CLIMATIC_CHAMBER_SHARING.***MASTER***  |
| CLIMATIC_CHAMBER_1.*Real device*     |
| CLIMATIC_CHAMBER_2.*Real device*     |
| COOLANT_COND_SHARING.***MASTER***      |
| COOLANT_COND_1.*Real device*         |
|   |


## First start

```{hint}
We recommend, for the first start, to use the simulated components and to limit the number of instances. 
```
When you have reach this point, you are ready to start SCALE Battery master instance.
