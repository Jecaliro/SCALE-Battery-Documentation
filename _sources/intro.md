 Welcome to **SCALE** Battery Documentation!

> *Essential element of new transportation area, batteries are key part of the energy transition. In constant evolution, battery testing has to be innovative and reactive!*
 
 SCALE Battery (**S**tandard and **C**onfigurable **A**pplication for **L**aboratory **E**nvirronment) is a MORPHEE® application for battery test cells. It allows to perform test on: 
* Cells,
* Module
* Pack.

```{note}
**SCALE** also exists for many different kind of test cell on automotive market:
````{panels}
