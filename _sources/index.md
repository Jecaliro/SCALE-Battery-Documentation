 Welcome to **SCALE** Battery Documentation!

> *The essential element of new transportation area. In constant evolution, the battery testing has to be reactive!*
 
 SCALE Battery (**S**tandard and **C**onfigurable **A**pplication for **L**aboratory **E**nvirronment) is a MORPHEE application for battery test cells. It allows to perform test on: 
* Cells,
* Module
* Pack.

```{note}
**SCALE** also exists for many different kind of test cell on automotive market:
* **SCALE Engine** : The state of the art for all of your thermal and hybrid engine test benches. From End-Of-Line to Research & Development solution.
* **SCALE Emotor** : Adapt your test benches and working methods to new market trends. E-mobility is more than ever a reality!
* **SCALE Fuel Cell** : The new trend for power generation in modern vehicles. Tomorrowâ€™s ideas have already a SCALE solution today.
* **SCALE Epowertrain/Powertrain** : Testing the complete powertrain in its conventional, hybrid or electrical configuration is now possible.
